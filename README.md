## Introduction
The goal of this project is to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative, aiding businesses in understanding customer feedback. The repository includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment steps.

## Features
- Text preprocessing
- Sentiment classification
- Model evaluation
- Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step analysis

## Dataset
The dataset consists of restaurant reviews labeled as positive or negative. You can find the dataset [here](data/reviews.csv).

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aakarsh27/Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`

2. **Model Training**:
   - `02_model_training.ipynb`

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - `03_model_evaluation.ipynb`

## Models
The repository includes several machine learning models, such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## Results
The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results are available in the `03_model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook.
